## No longer maintained; I've personally come to experience many banks offering similar features within their apps and I'm tired of entering all my expenses manually. Feel free to use the app for your project.

[Monefy-web](https://vandenbroucke.github.io/monefy-web/) is a simple web layer for the analysis of financial records generated by the free to use [Monefy](http://www.monefy.me/) app.

### Features

* ✔️ Balance over time graph with date filtering
* ✔️ Simple analytical summary of selected time period (Savings and projections)
* ✔️ Costs and income visualized per category using a Sankey chart
* ✔️ Records by category listing and timeline
* ✔️ Monthly balance comparison (check how well you did compared to last year)
* 💡 New feature ideas? Submit an issue with the enhancement label [here](https://github.com/vandenbroucke/monefy-web/issues/new)!




## How does it work?

<p align="center">

</p>

Simply export your Monefy financial records as a CSV file and import it into [Monefy-web](https://vandenbroucke.github.io/monefy-web/). You then get presented a visual overview and some simple analysis of your financials. No personal data is tracked, shared or published. Feel free to fork the project and run it yourself! You can even use it offline if you are really that paranoid :).

Happy budgetting!
